**** 1) Training Model One ****

The program "train-namone" can be used to learn Model one probabilities from
a parallel corpus.

Let's say that we have two files in French and English:
> train.fr
> train.en

In order to train model one probabilities for P(fr|en), we run
$ train-namone train.fr train.en > probabilities.fr-en

We can calculate the probabilities in the opposite direction P(en|fr) also:
$ train-namone train.en train.fr > probabilities.en-fr

Finally, it is possible to calculate monolingual model one probabilities,
which are similar to a Trigger-based language model. Let's say we want to
calculate P(en|en):
$ train-namone -mono true train.en > probabilities.en-en

**** 2) Calculating Model One ****

Given a separate set of test data:
> test.fr
> test.en

We can calculate model one probabilities P(fr|en) and P(en|fr) using "namone":
$ namone test.fr test.en probabilities.fr-en > test.fr-en.scores
$ namone test.en test.fr probabilities.en-fr > test.en-fr.scores

We can also calculate monolingual model one probabilities P(en|en):
$ namone -mono true test.en probabilities.en-en > test.en-en.scores
